If you are not eligible, or do not agree to the Terms, then please do not use the Service.

1. Eligibility. You must be at least eighteen (18) years old to use the Service. By agreeing to the Terms, you represent and warrant to us: (i) that you are at least eighteen (18) years old (ii) that you have not previously been suspended or removed from the Service and (iii) that your registration and your use of the Service is in compliance with any and all applicable laws and regulations.

In such a case, “you” in these Terms refers to your Subscribing Organization, and any individual authorized to use the Service on behalf of the Subscribing Organization, including you.

2. Privacy Policy; End User License Agreement; Additional Terms

2.2 End User License Agreement. Your use of any mobile application or other downloadable software we may provide (each, an “App”) is subject to an End User License Agreement. The applicable End User License Agreement depends on your the platform on which the App is designed to run and the features of the App. The End User License Agreement will be presented to you when you download and/or install the App and will be accessible through the App. Apps are deemed part of the Service, and all such End User License Agreements are hereby incorporated into, and made a part of, the Terms by reference.

3. Modification of the Terms. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change the Terms on a going forward basis at any time. Please check the Terms periodically for changes. Your continued use of the Service after the changes become effective constitutes your binding acceptance of such changes. In the event that a change to the Terms materially modifies your rights or obligations, we will make an effort to notify you of the change, such as by sending you an email to the address we have on file for you, or presenting a pop-up window or other notification to you through the Service when you log in. Immaterial modifications are effective upon publication, and material changes will be effective upon the earlier of (a) continued use of the Service with actual knowledge of the modification, or (b) thirty (30) days following the change. For the avoidance of doubt, disputes arising hereunder will be resolved in accordance with the Terms in effect that the time the dispute arose.

You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password. You agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account.

14. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration

14.1 Generally. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Mozio in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Mozio agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with these Terms of the Service shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms. You understand and agree that, by entering into these Terms, you and Mozio are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.

14.2 Exceptions. Notwithstanding subsection (15.1, we both agree that nothing herein shall be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.

14.3 Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and Mozio will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Mozio.

14.4 Notice; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, we may send notice to you by electronic mail ("Notice"). Mozio's address for Notice is: [Mozio, Inc., 139 Townsend St., Suite 150, San Francisco, CA, 94115]. The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Mozio may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Mozio shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any; provided that if our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Mozio shall pay you the greater of (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, and (ii) the greatest amount offered by Mozio in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award.

14.5 Fees. Any arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in San Francisco, CA, provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse Mozio for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.

14.6 No class actions. YOU AND MOZIO AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Mozio agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

14.7 Modifications. In the event that Mozio makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Mozio's address for Notice), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Mozio's address for Notice, in which case your account with Mozio shall be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject shall survive.

14.8 Enforceability. If only Subsection 15.6 is found to be unenforceable or the entirety of this Section 15 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 15 shall be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 16 shall govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.

14.9 Any refund requests must be made within 30 days of the trip date, to allow for timely investigation.

15. Governing Law; Venue. These Terms, whether interpreted in a court of law or in arbitration, shall be governed by the laws of the State of California as they apply to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within California by California residents, and without regard to conflict of law principles. To the extent that any lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted hereunder, you and Mozio agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within the San Francisco, California for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes. We operate the Service from our offices in California, and we make no representations that information and materials included in the Service are appropriate or available for use in other locations. Access to the Service from any territory where the content is illegal is prohibited.

16. General. The Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference herein, constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and Mozio regarding your use of and access to the Service, and except as expressly permitted above may only be amended by a written agreement signed by authorized representatives of the parties. You may not assign or transfer the Terms or your rights hereunder, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign the Terms at any time without notice. The failure to require performance of any provision shall not affect our right to require performance at any time thereafter, nor shall a waiver of any breach or default of the Terms constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of paragraph headers in the Terms is for convenience only and shall not have any impact on the interpretation of particular provisions. In the event that any part of the Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part shall be given effect to the greatest extent possible and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect. Upon termination of the Terms, any provision which, by its nature or express terms should survive, will survive such termination or expiration, including, but not limited to, Section 5 with respect to the closing or termination of Mozio accounts and Sections 6 through 17.

17. Contact Information. If you have any questions regarding Mozio, the Service, or the Terms please contact us at info@mozio.com.
